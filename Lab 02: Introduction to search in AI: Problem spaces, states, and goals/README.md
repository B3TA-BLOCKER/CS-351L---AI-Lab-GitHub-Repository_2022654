# Notes on Search Algorithms

## What is a Search Algorithm?

Search algorithms are designed to search for relevant elements in a data structure. They are essential for accessing desired elements in a data structure and retrieving them when needed.

## What is the A* Algorithm?

The A* algorithm is used for finding the shortest path between an initial and a final point. It is commonly used in map traversal to find the shortest route. A* searches for the shortest path first, making it both an optimal and complete algorithm.
