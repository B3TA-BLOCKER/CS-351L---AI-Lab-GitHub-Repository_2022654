# Notes on Search Algorithms

## What is a Search Algorithm?

Search algorithms are designed to search for relevant elements in a data structure. They are essential for accessing desired elements in a data structure and retrieving them when needed.

## What is the A* Algorithm?

The A* algorithm is used for finding the shortest path between an initial and a final point. It is commonly used in map traversal to find the shortest route. A* searches for the shortest path first, making it both an optimal and complete algorithm.

# Escape the Haunted Maze üè∞üëª

A captivating project where you'll navigate through a maze filled with challenges and rewards. The A* algorithm is employed to chart a path that not only ensures escape from the maze but also maximizes the collection of scattered rewards.

## Overview

In this program, you will:

- **Navigate the Maze**: Avoid ghosts, find safe zones, and reach the treasure.
- **Collect Rewards**: Gather as many rewards as possible for a high score.
- **Optimize Pathfinding**: Use the A* algorithm to balance between escaping ghosts and collecting rewards.

## Components

1. **Ghosts**: 
   - Move randomly throughout the maze to add a challenge.

2. **Safe Zones**: 
   - Temporary areas where you can evade ghosts and regroup.

3. **Treasures**: 
   - The ultimate goal is to find and reach the treasure.

4. **Rewards**: 
   - Scattered throughout the maze, offering additional points.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Maze Generation**: 
   - Design a maze that includes ghosts, safe zones, rewards, and the treasure.

2. **Reward Collection**: 
   - Enhance the A* algorithm to prioritize reward collection while ensuring escape.

3. **Ghost Movement**: 
   - Implement random ghost movement to keep the gameplay dynamic.

4. **Pathfinding**: 
   - Adjust the pathfinding algorithm to consider both rewards and ghost positions.
