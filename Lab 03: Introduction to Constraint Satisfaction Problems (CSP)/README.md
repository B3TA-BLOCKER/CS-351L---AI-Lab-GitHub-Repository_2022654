## Overview

In this lab, we explored Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), a core concept in AI. We implemented a color map problem where different regions on a map are assigned colors under the constraint that no neighboring regions can share the same color.

- **CSP Problem**: Given a set of variables and constraints, we solved for values that satisfy all constraints. The lab involves creating Python scripts that implement the CSP solution through backtracking and other AI algorithms.
